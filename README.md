Practical Cloud Native Development with MicroProfile 4.0, published by
[Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/)

This repo is a supplement to the book, _Practical Cloud Native Development with
MicroProfile 4.0_ by John Alcorn, David Chan, Emily Jiang, Andy McCright and
Alasdair Nottingham. It includes runnable samples for Chapters 4, 6, and 11.
The real-world Stock Trader application used throughout the book is available
at https://github.com/IBMStockTrader.

[Chapter 4](ch4/) demonstrates how to build a RESTful application using
technologies such as Jakarta REST (aka JAX-RS), Jakarta Context and Dependency
Injection (aka CDI), and Jakarta APIs for JSON processing (JSON-P) and binding
(JSON-B) and the MicroProfile Rest Client.

[Chapter 6](ch6/) demonstrates how to add observability and metrics tracking to
a cloud native application. It describes MicroProfile Health, Metrics and Open
Tracing.

[Chapter 11](ch11/) demonstrates MicroProfile GraphQL and how you might use it
as an alternative to REST. The examples in this project build on the Stock
Trader application.

All of the examples in this repository use open source software such as
[Jakarta EE](https://jakarta.ee/), [MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io/),
[Open Liberty](https://openliberty.io/) and more. To run these sample
applications, please refer to the README file under each chapter.
